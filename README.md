### <div align="center">Project description:<br><br>
We would like a web application that allows users to list spaces they have available, and to hire spaces for the night.</div>

### <div align="center">Headline specifications:

Any signed-up user can list a new space.
Users can list multiple spaces.

Users should be able to name their space, provide a short description of the space, and a price per night.

Users should be able to offer a range of dates where their space is available.

Any signed-up user can request to hire any space for one night, and this should be approved by the user that owns that space.

Nights for which a space has already been booked should not be available for users to book that space.

Until a user has confirmed a booking request, that space can still be booked for that night.</div>
  
### <div align="center">MVP:
By tuesday afternoon, our minimum viable product is to have a functioning web page that allows a user to create an account and view listed rooms. We aim to do this by creating a database that holds account detsails and room details. 
For example. The room details table could contain the room name, owned by who, booked by who and dates.</div>
